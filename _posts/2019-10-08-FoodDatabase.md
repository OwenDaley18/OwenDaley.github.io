# Project Overview 
Worked with 3 other students to create an online Food Donations Database that could receive non-perishable foods from business that various charity programs could then claim. This project was created during the DubHacks 2019 annual Hackathon. 

# Front-end Development
For the web UI of our project, we used the development framework REACT implemented with javascript. We created a regristration system to where business could sign up to donate food items, and feeding organizations could register to receive the donated food. 

# Back-end Development
We used SQL and Spark Java for the Back-end development. We created a database that could store both donated food items as well as requests for food items. This part of the project was the most difficult for me to implement as I had never used SQL or Spark Java before. 

# Main Takeaways
This was my first ever Hackathon, and my first major role as a Software Developer. Through this experience I gained both more knowledge of Software Design and implementation, specifically implementing GIT, JSONS and Web development. Furthermore, this experience also provided me with insight and experience on working in teams and effectively dividing up work. Overall, this project helped introduce me to fundamental CSE skills and is why I decided to pursue Computer Science.
